## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
//answer
it allows a developer to store his work in cloud and be able to access it even if his machine is destroyed or the codes are locally tamperd with.
it maintains intergrity by keeping track of every change made to the codes
it helps developers work as a team by enabling collaboration.
## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?
//answer
While in githu dashbord, you click the button written new or the button with a plus sign on it
You will be presented with a page which will require you to enter the repository name and a small description fdor the repository
You then need to make a very important decision of whether the repository should be public or private
Add a read me which is where you will write a full and long description of the repository

Commits help track thi changes to ensure intergrity in collaborative projects

## How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.

## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?

## Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?

## Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.

## Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?
